# 🚀 Operational Cost Forecasting & Variance Analysis

**A strategic analysis project simulating Tesla-style operational data across departments and regions, designed to forecast OpEx, identify inefficiencies, and surface critical business insights.**  
Developed using Python, this project combines cost modeling, KPI engineering, and high-impact visual storytelling to support decisions across finance, manufacturing, and technical operations.

---

## 📈 Objective

To build a robust cost forecasting and analysis pipeline that mirrors real-world challenges faced by FP&A, TPM, and operations teams — including:
- Predicting total operational spend across departments and regions
- Measuring accuracy of financial forecasts
- Tracking downtime and cost drivers
- Visualizing key performance indicators to support resource planning and risk reduction

---

## 🧠 Business Context

This project simulates operational cost tracking for departments such as Assembly, Logistics, and Paint across Tesla locations like Fremont and Berlin. It covers:
- Maintenance, labor, material, and energy costs
- Operational and downtime hours
- Forecasted vs. actual variance
- Region-specific cost behavior

It's built for scenarios where **finance and technical operations intersect**, such as:
- Manufacturing Test TPM validating station performance
- FP&A evaluating cost allocation and budgeting drift
- Energy or Fleet teams tracking downtime cost and uptime efficiency

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python (pandas, numpy)** – for data wrangling and KPI engineering  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for advanced data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive development and reporting  
- *(Optional)* Tableau – for executive dashboards

## 🔍 Dataset Overview

10,000+ simulated records with the following key fields:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Department` | Functional unit (e.g., Assembly, Battery) |
| `Region` | Global site (Fremont, Austin, Berlin) |
| `Month` | Time series dimension |
| `Operational_Hours` | Expected uptime hours per unit |
| `Downtime_Hours` | Lost hours due to failure or delay |
| `Forecasted_Total_Cost_USD` | Predicted cost for that unit/month |
| `Maintenance`, `Labor`, `Material`, `Energy` | Cost breakdown by category |

---

## 📊 Key KPIs Engineered

1. **Downtime Ratio** — downtime / operational hours  
2. **Maintenance Cost per Operational Hour**  
3. **Labor, Material, and Energy Cost % of Forecasted Total**  
4. **Forecast Accuracy & Cost Variance Trends**  

Each KPI is calculated at the **department-region-month** level and visualized for high-level and granular insights.

---

## 📌 Visualizations

- 📉 Line chart showing forecasted cost trend over time  
- 📦 Bar/box plots comparing cost ratios by department  
- 📍 Region-based variance tracking  
- 🔥 Heatmaps to identify departments consistently over budget

Each visual helps translate cost data into **actionable decisions** — whether that means reallocating resources, reducing waste, or flagging budget drift.
